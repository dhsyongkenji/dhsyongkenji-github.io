<p>
My name is Kenji Yong. I am a student of Dunman High School. I am currently in Year 1 at Dunman High. </p>
<p>
Hereâ€™s our school website link <a href ="www.dhs.sg"> Dunman High School  </a>. </p>
<br>
<p>Here are the things I love to do the most : </p> 
<ul>
<li>Cycling</li>
<p>I love cycling a lot. Cycling is a great form of exercise and also a great way to explore singapore. I always cycle long distances for 4
 hours straight. Just to give you an idea of how far I usually cycle, I always cycle from Fengshan all the way to Marina Bay. In conclusion,
 cycling is great and I feel that everyone should start cycling.</p>
<li>Travelling and Exploring Places</li>
<p>Actually, exploring places is part of cycling. As I cycle along the roads and the PCNs(Park Connectors), I am taken to different parts of
 Singapore. By doing so, I learn and discover more places.</p>
<li>Playing soccer</li>
<p>90 minutes of pure exercise. That's what soccer is. I am sure you can tell now that soccer is an extremely tough and exhausting game.
 After every soccer game, I feel slimmer and I feel super exhausted. That is because soccer requires you to run for 90 minutes non-stop,
 under the blazing hot sun. If you watch Premier League or any other football leagues, you will see that despite playing in winter, players 
 will still sweat a lot. So if you want to lose weight quickly, start soccer.</p>
